# Mobile Apps to Reduce Cross-Race Recognition Deficit

This project aims to build on last year's work to help publish two mobile apps that help reduce and study CRD. We know that training can work to reduce this deficit. This project aims to be another helpful training assist for users in reducing their own CRD. This app would use various exercises to train users in individuating faces of other races and measure progress over time.

In addition to training end-users’ cross-race facial recognition. This project is intended to aid researchers in the CU Psychology Department with making sense of racial bias, and how processes are influenced by race through data collection within the app.

## Mission, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience

The Department of Psychology and Neuroscience is composed of Faculty, Staff, Research Assistants, Graduate Students, and Undergraduate Students. Through teaching, learning, research, and community outreach, we seek to promote scholarship at the intersection of psychology and neuroscience. Driving this mission is a deep, shared commitment to improving the human condition for all people.

## Benefit and Impact
Data generated from this app can be used by the CU Boulder Psychology Department to further research on reducing the effect of the CRD.

There is really no current way for a user to practice individuating faces of other races and therefore reduce their CRD. The created apps can service such a need. Given the potential progression research and racial advancements, these apps provide ​this project is work doing.
  
## How the app is built
This is a multiplatform project. The app is written using Ionic, which is an open-source mobile UI toolkit for building high-quality, cross-platform native and web app experiences. Both the android and the iOS apps use a single code base. The app is written mostly in Typescript CSS, and, HTML.

## Front end
Ionic provides a web interface to view changes you're making to the front end live. All you have to do to see changes is save the files your working on and Ionic will recompile and refresh.

In your terminal of choice navigate to /psych-capstone/front-end
Run ``ionic serve`` to start the app:

Run ``ionic serve -l`` for a vary helpfuly mobile view:

## Back end

Run ``node index.js`` from root to start a server:

You need to include an auth.json file with a DATABASE_URL parameter to connect to a database when running locally.
